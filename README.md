DOGE API Data Export Tool
This tool allows you to interact with the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) API and export data to Excel files.

Overview
Based on the research, the DOGE API is being developed to provide access to government data, including:

Department information
Employee data
Budget information
Efficiency metrics
Projects and initiatives
This tool provides a flexible framework for:

Making requests to the API
Processing the JSON responses
Exporting the data to Excel files
Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd doge-api-export
Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment variables (optional): Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
DOGE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.doge.gov
DOGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DOGE_API_VERSION=v1
DOGE_OUTPUT_DIR=doge_data
Usage
Basic Command Line Usage
The tool can be used from the command line to export data:

bash
# Export all data types
python doge_api_processor.py --all

# Export specific data type
python doge_api_processor.py --data-type departments

# Export with filters
python doge_api_processor.py --data-type employees --filter "department=Treasury"

# Specify output directory
python doge_api_processor.py --all --output-dir exports

# Disable timestamp in filenames
python doge_api_processor.py --all --no-timestamp
Programmatic Usage
You can also use the API client programmatically in your own Python scripts:

python
from doge_api_client import DogeApiClient

# Initialize client
client = DogeApiClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Get department data
departments = client.get_department_data()

# Get employee data with filter
employees = client.get_employee_data(department="Treasury")

# Export data to Excel
file_path = client.export_to_excel(employees, "treasury_employees", "Treasury Employees")
print(f"Data exported to: {file_path}")

# Export all available data
results = client.export_all_data()
Check the example_usage.py file for more detailed examples.

Supported Data Types
The tool currently supports exporting the following data types:

Departments - Information about government departments
Employees - Employee data including position, salary, etc.
Budget - Budget information by department and fiscal year
Efficiency Metrics - Performance and efficiency metrics
Projects - Information about government projects and initiatives
Error Handling
The tool includes robust error handling and logging:

Connection errors are automatically retried with exponential backoff
All errors are logged to both console and log file
Detailed error messages help diagnose issues
Notes
This tool is built based on publicly available information about the DOGE API. The actual API endpoints and data structures may differ when the API is officially released. You may need to modify the code to match the actual API specification once it becomes available.
